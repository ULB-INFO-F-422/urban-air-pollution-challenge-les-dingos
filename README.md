This repository is dedicated to showcasing our work for INFO-F-422-Statistical Foundations of Machine Learning course at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles. Our focus lies on the Urban Air Pollution Challenge hosted on Zindi, which revolves around predicting daily PM2.5 particulate matter concentrations for various cities globally.

# Project Goals:
* Develop Machine Learning Models: Our primary aim is to construct machine learning models capable of forecasting daily PM2.5 concentrations for diverse cities.

* Evaluation Metrics: We will assess the performance of these models using accuracy and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metrics, opting for the one exhibiting the highest test accuracy.

* Identify Effective Predictors: Additionally, we aspire to determine which variables within the dataset serve as the most potent predictors of PM2.5 levels.

* Support Pollution Control: Ultimately, our overarching objective is to bolster pollution control initiatives and shield at-risk demographics from the adverse effects of air pollution.
